# Prova finale di ingegneria del software - a.a. 2020-2021
The aim of the project is to develop a software version of the game "Master of Renaissance".

###Developers
This particular version was developed by Lisa Cosaro, Raffaello Fornasiere and Leonardo Scapolan.

###Implemented functionalities

- GUI
- Socket
- Two advanced functionalities: "Partite multiple" and "Partita locale"

###Documentation
The project is accompanied by several UML diagrams:

- A [simplified UML diagram](https://github.com/RaffaelloFornasiere/ing-sw-2021-Cosaro-Fornasiere-Scapolan/blob/main/deliverables/UMLdiagram/SimplifiedUML.png) detailing the main classes of the application and their iteration
- A [initial UML diagram](https://github.com/RaffaelloFornasiere/ing-sw-2021-Cosaro-Fornasiere-Scapolan/blob/main/deliverables/UMLdiagram/InitialUML.png) showing the initial concept for the model where the development of the application started (as such it might slightly differ from the final implementation)
- A [sequence diagram](https://github.com/RaffaelloFornasiere/ing-sw-2021-Cosaro-Fornasiere-Scapolan/tree/main/deliverables/UMLdiagram/Sequence%20Diagrams/PlayerJoiningGame) showing the network interaction and the act of a user joining a lobby, together with an explanatory text
- A [sequence diagram](https://github.com/RaffaelloFornasiere/ing-sw-2021-Cosaro-Fornasiere-Scapolan/tree/main/deliverables/UMLdiagram/Sequence%20Diagrams/Buy%20a%20resource) showing the action of buying resources from the market, together with an explanatory text
- A [sequence diagram](https://github.com/RaffaelloFornasiere/ing-sw-2021-Cosaro-Fornasiere-Scapolan/tree/main/deliverables/UMLdiagram/Sequence%20Diagrams/PlayLeaderCard) showing the action of activating a leader card, together with an explanatory text
- A series of [complete UML diagrams](https://github.com/RaffaelloFornasiere/ing-sw-2021-Cosaro-Fornasiere-Scapolan/tree/main/deliverables/UMLdiagram/CompleteUML) for the whole application
